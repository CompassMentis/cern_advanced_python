You may want to start with ex01 - this exercise is based on more complex code

Optimise k_nearest_neighbour.py, as follows:

- Run the code
- View the image which this created, ../data/data_points_grouped.gif
- Read through the code, try to understand it
- Use timeit to time the code. Run the code 10 times. Print out the average time and make a note of it
- Rename or copy the created image, so you can use it as a rough check that the code still works by comparing it against the new result
- Optimise the code:
    - Run it with a profiler
    - Look at the profiler output and the code, pick something which looks promising
    - Make some (suspected) improvement
    - Compare the new time against the previous time
    - (optional) Write down what you changed and how the time changed
    - Repeat
